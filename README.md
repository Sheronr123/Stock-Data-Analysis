This project analyzes historical stock data for Amazon, Google, Microsoft, and Apple. By leveraging time series analysis and various statistical methods, we gain insights into stock price trends, moving averages, and perform multivariate analysis. The analysis is visualized using matplotlib, pandas, and seaborn to create a comprehensive view of stock performance over time.

This project provides a detailed analysis of stock data for four major tech companies: Amazon, Google, Microsoft, and Apple. The analysis focuses on:
* Evaluating stock price trends over time
* Calculating and visualizing moving averages to assess stock momentum
* Resampling stock data for different time intervals (weekly, monthly)
* Conducting multivariate analysis to identify relationships between stocks


Features:

* Stock Price Analysis - Visualized stock prices over time to assess trends.
